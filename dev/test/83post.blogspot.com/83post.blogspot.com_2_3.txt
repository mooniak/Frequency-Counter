ජය වේවා !









Mahendran told Majid to tell Mathew to remind Malith; that today was his father's 30th death anniversary.


Malith told Mahendran he was sorry.


Mathew asked Malith whether he really was.


Majid replied, "I certainly hope he is."


Mathew went blank. Malith looked down in guilt.


As Mahendran shed a silent tear, Majid trembled in fear.

Fight of Irony










The sun shined on her face


Caressed her in a beautiful embrace


In her hair, a white flower she placed


A smile brightened up the July haze




The Sun slowly faded away


Blackened on its 23rd day


A little boy had come to play


And the darkness was here to stay




Smiles turned in to tears


Words churned in to fears


When she couldn't say the word bucket


He strapped her throat to the locket




The boy swung his blade


Her smile began to fade


In a ring of blazing fire


Her face melted in to the tire




Not seeing what was to come


Oblivious to what he had become


Not knowing what he had done


His war had already begun




He put his hand in to his pocket,


Pulled out a Gold Leaf packet,


From the fire that burnt on her hair,


He lit a cigarette with no despair




The smoke blew across the town,


In a wind that was black and brown,


With the darkness of its solemn frown,


The tears from the sky fell down




A year and a twenty nine later,


He looks back at the left over crater,


Trembling in guilt he cannot not cater,






He fights for peace, love and greater

Kill 'em all and be enlighten











With sorrow sunken eyes, Vishnu looked down upon Earth. To a depressed and dejected Mohammed he said;

"Look, they have started fighting again. When will it ever end?"

"At least they aren't killing people in your name. They have forgotten the very fundamentals this religion was created upon.", said Mohammed, shaking his head.

The Buddha, who had been listening to their conversation, added the punch.

"They've even started killing themselves in my name, setting themselves on fire. Suicide, in every sense of the word."

"Maybe it is time for me to go down there",
said Maitriya, the next in line for enlightenment.

Jesus, who was thus far silently observing what was going on in Earth said;

"No, they will hurt you too. Look, they've started dividing their own groups in to smaller groups."

"Well, looks like everything is going according to plan then, my good sirs.”,

said the government official triumphantly, and descended down to the parliament.
