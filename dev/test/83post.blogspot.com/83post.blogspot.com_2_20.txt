Kill 'em all and be enlighten










With sorrow sunken eyes, Vishnu looked down upon Earth. To a depressed and dejected Mohammed he said;

"Look, they have started fighting again. When will it ever end?"

"At least they aren't killing people in your name. They have forgotten the very fundamentals this religion was created upon.", said Mohammed, shaking his head.

The Buddha, who had been listening to their conversation, added the punch.

"They've even started killing themselves in my name, setting themselves on fire. Suicide, in every sense of the word."

"Maybe it is time for me to go down there",
said Maitriya, the next in line for enlightenment.

Jesus, who was thus far silently observing what was going on in Earth said;

"No, they will hurt you too. Look, they've started dividing their own groups in to smaller groups."

"Well, looks like everything is going according to plan then, my good sirs.”,

said the government official triumphantly, and descended down to the parliament.
