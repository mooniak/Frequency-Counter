Fight of Irony









The sun shined on her face


Caressed her in a beautiful embrace


In her hair, a white flower she placed


A smile brightened up the July haze




The Sun slowly faded away


Blackened on its 23rd day


A little boy had come to play


And the darkness was here to stay




Smiles turned in to tears


Words churned in to fears


When she couldn't say the word bucket


He strapped her throat to the locket




The boy swung his blade


Her smile began to fade


In a ring of blazing fire


Her face melted in to the tire




Not seeing what was to come


Oblivious to what he had become


Not knowing what he had done


His war had already begun




He put his hand in to his pocket,


Pulled out a Gold Leaf packet,


From the fire that burnt on her hair,


He lit a cigarette with no despair




The smoke blew across the town,


In a wind that was black and brown,


With the darkness of its solemn frown,


The tears from the sky fell down




A year and a twenty nine later,


He looks back at the left over crater,


Trembling in guilt he cannot not cater,






He fights for peace, love and greater
