the 83 post


















I have a very distance but a sharp  memory on ' the 83 post'.May be I was Four or five  when it happened. We, my mother and I  waited for my farther for a long time near a mile post.




"அன்பே காத்திருக்க"



that is what my mother said when I asked where is Papa.

So We just waited there. For an hour, then a day.

Then I remember I started  crying. If I didn't cry I wouldn't be able to write this. If we waited more I wouldn't be here to tell this.

'the 83 post'- the sharpest visual memory in my early child hood.
