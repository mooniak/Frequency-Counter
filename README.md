# textual-tools

Set of scripts and tools to grab, analyze, manipulate text for type design related purposes or for just fun :)

##How To

Script can analyze a website or text files stored locally in your computer. Files should b in `.txt` format.


This will generate a `json` file and a html representation of analysis.

```
python3 main.py [-l/-w][URL / folder or file][levels only if a URL, optional][output file, optional]
```

- l for local
- w for web
